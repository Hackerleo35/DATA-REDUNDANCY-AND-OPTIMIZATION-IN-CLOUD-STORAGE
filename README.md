# DATA-REDUNDANCY-AND-OPTIMIZATION-IN-CLOUD-STORAGE
The project investigates how cloud storage adopts data redundancy for reliability, and optimization techniques such as deduplication, compression, caching, and tiered storage are effective in reducing cost while enhancing performance, hence showing a balanced, efficient cloud storage system.
